# contrib/tools/devskim 

This directory contains the driver for running the
[`DevSkim`](https://github.com/microsoft/DevSkim) analysis tool.

## Installation

To make use of this driver, you need `DevSkim` on
the local machine. This can be achieved with
[installers/install.sh](./installers/install.sh) which simply
downloads and extracts the latest public `DevSkim` bundle.

## Configuration

To make use of the local `DevSkim`, add a tools entry in the config file 
as instructed by the install script above. 

```json
{
  ...
  "tools": {
    ...

    "devskim-default": {
      "bin": "node",
      "args": [
        "/home/user-name/ossf-cve-benchmark/build/ts/contrib/tools/devskim/src/devskim.js"
      ],
      "options": {
        "devskimDir": "/home/user-name/analysis-tools/devskim-default/DevSkim_CLI_linux_1.0.23"
      }
    },
    ...
  }
  ...
}
```

This will allow you to use the tool-id `devskim-default` in `cli/bin run
--tool devskim-default`.
